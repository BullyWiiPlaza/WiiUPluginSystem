/**
    This defines a function replacement.
    It allows to replace the system function with an own function. 
    So whenever a game / application calles an overridden function, your function gets called instead.
    
    Currently it's only possible to override functions that are loaded from .rpl files of OSv10 (00050010-1000400A).
    
    Signature of this macro:
    DECL_FUNCTION(  RETURN_TYPE, ARBITRARY_NAME_OF_FUNCTION , ARGS_SEPERATED_BY_COMMA){
        //Your code goes here.
    }
    
    Within this macro, two more function get declare you can use.
    my_ARBITRARY_NAME_OF_FUNCTION and real_FSOpenFile
    
    RETURN_TYPE my_ARBITRARY_NAME_OF_FUNCTION(ARGS_SEPERATED_BY_COMMA):
        is just name of the function that gets declared in this macro. 
        It has the same effect as calling the overridden function directly.
    
    RETURN_TYPE real_ARBITRARY_NAME_OF_FUNCTION(ARGS_SEPERATED_BY_COMMA):
        is the name of the function, that leads to function that was overridden.
        Use this to call the original function that will be overridden.
        CAUTION: Other plugins may already have manipulated the the return value or arguments.
        
    
    Use this macro for each function you want to override

**/
DECL_FUNCTION(int, FSOpenFile, FSClient *pClient, FSCmdBlock *pCmd, const char *path, const char *mode, int *handle, int error) {
    int result = real_FSOpenFile(pClient, pCmd, path, mode, handle, error);
