## Building

For building you need: 
- [dynamic_libs](https://github.com/Maschell/dynamic_libs/tree/lib) for access to the functions.
- [libutils](https://github.com/Maschell/libutils) for common functions.
- [libfswrapper](https://github.com/Maschell/fs_wrapper) to replace the fs functions.


Install them (in this order) according to their README's. Don't forget the dependencies of the libs itself.
