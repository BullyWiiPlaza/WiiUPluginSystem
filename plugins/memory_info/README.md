## Building

For building you need: 
- [wups](https://github.com/Maschell/WiiUPluginSystem)
- [dynamic_libs](https://github.com/Maschell/dynamic_libs/tree/lib) for access to the functions.
- [libutils](https://github.com/Maschell/libutils) for common functions.


Install them (in this order) according to their README's. Don't forget the dependencies of the libs itself.
